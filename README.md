# java-applications

some java classical game applications: implementation of game logic and game interface, audio and images are nested inside.

Time to compile and play around!!! :)

Have you ever wondered how PacMan works? Or Snake or Brick Braker? Well, it'a all about how you map your game's logic into the virtual space.

If you use cmd compilation just run you favourite java compiler on the java Main files in the source dir, then run the created class and have fur.

# Exemple:

### javac Main.java
### java Main / java Main.class
